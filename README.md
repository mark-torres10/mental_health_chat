### Mental Health Conversational Chatbots, using Deep Learning

This is a series of simple implementations, using deep learning methods, to create conversational chatbots 
trained on real conversations between patients and trained psychiatrists. The end goal of this project is to 
use current conversational AI research in order to create more realistic mental health chatbots. 

This project was inspired by the mental health startup Woebot (https://woebot.io/).
